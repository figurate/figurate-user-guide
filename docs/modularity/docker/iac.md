# Docker

Docker is the most popular incarnation of the Container-as-a-Service (CaaS)
application model, whereby applications are packaged and executed in isolated
containers.

Docker is extremely versatile in that it supports any language or application
that runs on Linux, resulting modern applications that can be designed as a
collection of modular containers that integrate to form robust and easy to maintain
architectures.
