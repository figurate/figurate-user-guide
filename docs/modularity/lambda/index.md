# Lambda

AWS Lambda is the most popular implementation of Function as a service (FaaS),
whereby loosely-coupled functions are deployed and managed independently.

The primary benefit of Lambda is that there are no hosts that need patching and
maintenance, allowing the DevOps team to focus entirely on the application (function)
code.
