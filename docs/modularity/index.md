# Modular Architectures

Application architectures must continually evolve and grow not only
to meet future needs but to stay relevant and secure in an ecosystem
that is continually changing.

Because of the need for constant growth a monolithic architecture will
eventually become very difficult to maintain in both size and complexity.
For this reason modular architectures make more sense for even the smallest
applications to be able to not only manage components independently, but
to allow for upgrade and replacement of different components over time.
